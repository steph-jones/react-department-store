# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   movies = Movie.create([{ name: 'Star Wars' }, { name: 'Lord of the Rings' }])
#   Character.create(name: 'Luke', movie: movies.first)

# 5.times do
#     Department.create(
#         name: Faker::Commerce.department,
#     )
# end;

# nums = [3,4,5,6,7,8]
# 50.times do
#     Item.create(
#         name: Faker::Commerce.product_name,
#         price: Faker::Commerce.price,
#         description: Faker::Marketing.buzzwords,
#         department_id: nums.sample,
#     )
# end;

# puts("seed complete: 50 items")
